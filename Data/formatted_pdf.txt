            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County has shown a remarkable trajectory from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the total GRP was $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 saw a slight increase in the GRP to $244.82 billion and a per capita GRP of $74,277.60. This resilience can be attributed to the diverse economic base of the region, which includes strong sectors such as healthcare, government, and finance. The year 2021 marked a significant recovery and growth, with the GRP rising to $268.87 billion and the per capita GRP reaching $82,099.95, reflecting an economic rebound as restrictions eased and businesses adapted to the new normal. The upward trajectory continued in 2022, with the GRP growing to $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10. This growth can be attributed to the expansion in key industries such as professional, scientific, and technical services, as well as manufacturing. In 2023, the GRP growth rate slowed to approximately 4.1%, reaching $308.71 billion, while the per capita GRP rose to $94,915.87, indicating a stabilization of the economic recovery and reflecting the overall economic prosperity of the region. Over the five-year period, San Diego County's GRP grew from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023, representing a total growth of approximately 26.4%. The per capita GRP increased from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023, indicating a significant improvement in economic output per resident. The data suggests that San Diego County has a robust and resilient economy, capable of recovering from economic disruptions and continuing to grow. The key sectors driving this growth include government, healthcare, professional services, and manufacturing.",
