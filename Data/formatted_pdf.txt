            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to about $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, indicating an increase in economic output per person. This trend continued into 2021, where the GRP experienced a significant rise to approximately $268.87 billion. The per capita GRP jumped to $82,099.95, even as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954, suggesting a strong economic recovery and growth post-2020. By 2022, the GRP had grown to around $296.68 billion, with the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, supported by a stable population of 3,276,208. This reflects continued economic expansion and increased productivity. In 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, with the per capita GRP reaching $94,915.87, despite a population decrease to 3,252,468. The sustained rise in per capita GRP suggests ongoing economic growth and efficiency. Overall, over the five-year period, San Diego County's GRP increased by approximately $64.43 billion, from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. The per capita GRP increased by $21,568.95, from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023. This data indicates a robust economic performance, with significant growth in economic output both in total and on a per capita basis, despite fluctuations in population. This suggests improvements in productivity and economic resilience in San Diego County.",
