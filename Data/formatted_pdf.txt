In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, and by 2023, it had risen to about $308.71 billion. This increase of approximately $64.43 billion over five years highlights the region's economic resilience and expansion. The annual growth patterns reveal that from 2019 to 2020, the GRP experienced a modest increase of $0.54 billion, reaching $244.82 billion, a reflection of the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the subsequent years saw more robust growth, with the GRP rising by $24.05 billion in 2021 as the economy began to recover, followed by an increase of $27.81 billion in 2022, and a further $12.03 billion in 2023, culminating in a GRP of $308.71 billion.",

This growth in per capita GRP suggests that the economic benefits were not only widespread but also significant on an individual level. When compared to broader benchmarks, San Diego County's per capita GRP in 2023 was higher than the state average of California, which stood at $93,800, and significantly above the national average of $77,366. This comparison underscores the county's strong economic performance relative to both state and national levels.",
