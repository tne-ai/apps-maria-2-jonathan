            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to about $244.82 billion. Interestingly, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, suggesting an increase in economic output per person even as the overall population declined. The year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, while the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This indicates a robust economic recovery and growth post-2020. The upward trajectory continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching around $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, alongside a stable population of 3,276,208. This reflects ongoing economic expansion and heightened productivity. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, with a population of 3,252,468. The sustained rise in per capita GRP suggests continued economic growth and efficiency. Overall, over the five-year period, San Diego County's GRP increased by approximately $64.43 billion, from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. The per capita GRP saw an increase of $21,568.95, from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023. This data indicates a robust economic performance, with consistent growth in both total GRP and per capita GRP, despite fluctuations in population, suggesting improvements in economic productivity and efficiency in the region.",
