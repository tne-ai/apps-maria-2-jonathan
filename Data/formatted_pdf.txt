In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, and by 2023, it had risen to about $308.71 billion. This increase of roughly $64.43 billion over five years highlights the region's economic expansion. Despite the global economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRP showed resilience, with a slight increase from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $244.82 billion in 2020. The subsequent years marked a recovery phase, with the GRP reaching $268.87 billion in 2021, $296.68 billion in 2022, and finally $308.71 billion in 2023. This growth pattern underscores the region's economic resilience and recovery capabilities.",
