The year 2021 marked a significant recovery with the GRP rising to approximately $268.87 billion, a growth of about 9.82% from the previous year. This indicates a strong economic rebound post-pandemic. The upward trajectory continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching approximately $296.68 billion, reflecting a growth of about 10.34% from 2021. This sustained economic expansion highlights the robust recovery phase. In 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, marking a growth of about 4.06% from 2022. Although the growth rate slowed compared to the previous year, it suggests a stabilization phase following the rapid recovery from the pandemic-induced economic downturn.
