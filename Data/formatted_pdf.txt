From 2019 to 2023, the GRP has consistently increased, reflecting the region's economic resilience and growth. In 2019, the GRP stood at approximately $244.28 billion, and despite the global challenges faced in 2020, it saw a slight increase to $244.82 billion. The upward trend continued more robustly in the subsequent years, with the GRP reaching $268.87 billion in 2021, $296.68 billion in 2022, and finally peaking at $308.71 billion in 2023. This steady growth underscores the dynamic economic activities and the robust economic framework of San Diego County.",
