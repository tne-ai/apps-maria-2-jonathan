            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, and by 2023, it had risen to about $308.71 billion. This increase of approximately $64.43 billion over five years highlights the region's robust economic expansion. The annual GRP figures reveal a steady rise: $244.28 billion in 2019, $244.82 billion in 2020, $268.87 billion in 2021, $296.68 billion in 2022, and $308.71 billion in 2023. The year-over-year growth patterns further illustrate this trend. From 2019 to 2020, the GRP saw a modest increase of about $0.54 billion, likely influenced by the global economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the subsequent years showed a strong recovery, with the GRP increasing by approximately $24.05 billion from 2020 to 2021, $27.81 billion from 2021 to 2022, and $12.03 billion from 2022 to 2023, indicating sustained growth.",
