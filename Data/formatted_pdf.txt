Interestingly, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, suggesting an increase in economic output per person even as the overall population declined. The year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, while the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This indicates a robust economic recovery and growth post-2020. The upward trajectory continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching approximately $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, alongside a population of 3,276,208.

By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, with the per capita GRP reaching $94,915.87, despite a slight population decrease to 3,252,468.
