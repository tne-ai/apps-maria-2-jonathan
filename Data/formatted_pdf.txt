            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to about $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, indicating an increase in economic output per person.\n\nThe year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP, reaching approximately $268.87 billion. The per capita GRP also saw a substantial increase to $82,099.95, even as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This suggests a strong economic recovery and growth post-2020. The upward trajectory continued in 2022, with the GRP growing to around $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, while the population remained stable at 3,276,208. This reflects ongoing economic expansion and increased productivity.\n\nIn 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, with the per capita GRP reaching $94,915.87, despite a slight population decrease to 3,252,468. The continued rise in per capita GRP suggests sustained economic growth and efficiency. Overall, over the five-year period, San Diego County's GRP increased by approximately $64.43 billion, from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. The per capita GRP rose by $21,568.95, from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023. This data indicates a robust economic performance, with consistent growth in both total GRP and per capita GRP, despite fluctuations in population, suggesting improvements in economic productivity and efficiency in the region.",
