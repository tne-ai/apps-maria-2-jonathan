            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, calculated by dividing the total GRP by the population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to about $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, suggesting an increase in economic output per person, possibly due to productivity gains or shifts in industry contributions. The year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, even as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This indicates a robust economic recovery or expansion, likely driven by key industries. In 2022, the GRP continued its growth trajectory, reaching approximately $296.68 billion, and the per capita GRP increased to $90,557.10, with a stable population of 3,276,208. This reflects sustained economic growth and possibly increased efficiency or higher value-added activities in the region. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, with the per capita GRP reaching $94,915.87, despite a population decrease to 3,252,468. The continued rise in per capita GRP suggests ongoing economic development and possibly a shift towards more high-value industries. Overall, San Diego County's GRP has shown consistent growth from 2019 to 2023, with notable increases in both total GRP and per capita GRP. The increase in per capita GRP, despite fluctuations in population, indicates improvements in economic productivity and possibly a shift towards more lucrative sectors. The data suggests that San Diego County has been resilient and adaptive, maintaining economic growth through potential challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.",
