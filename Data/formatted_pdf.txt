In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, and by 2023, it had risen to about $308.71 billion. This increase of approximately $64.43 billion over the five-year period highlights the region's robust economic growth. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRP experienced a slight increase from 2019 to 2020, moving from $244.28 billion to $244.82 billion. This modest growth set the stage for a significant recovery and expansion phase, as evidenced by the substantial rise to $268.87 billion in 2021. The growth momentum continued, with the GRP reaching $296.68 billion in 2022 and further increasing to $308.71 billion in 2023.",
