            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trajectory, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, calculated based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to about $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, indicating an increase in economic output per person, possibly due to productivity gains or shifts in the economic structure. The year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, even as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This suggests a robust economic recovery or expansion, likely driven by key industries in the region. In 2022, the GRP continued its growth, reaching around $296.68 billion, and the per capita GRP increased to $90,557.10, with a stable population of 3,276,208. This growth reflects strong economic performance, possibly due to increased activity in sectors like technology, healthcare, and tourism. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, despite a slight population decrease to 3,252,468. The continued rise in per capita GRP suggests ongoing economic strength and resilience in San Diego County. Overall, San Diego County's GRP has shown consistent growth from 2019 to 2023, with a notable increase in per capita GRP each year. This indicates not only an expanding economy but also an increase in economic output per resident. The growth in GRP and per capita GRP suggests that the county's economy is becoming more productive and possibly more diversified, with key sectors contributing to this upward trend. The slight fluctuations in population do not seem to have negatively impacted the overall economic growth, as evidenced by the rising per capita GRP figures. This analysis highlights the economic resilience and growth potential of San Diego County over the analyzed period.",
