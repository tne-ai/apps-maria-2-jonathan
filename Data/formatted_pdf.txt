            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, calculated by dividing the total GRP by the population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to approximately $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, suggesting an increase in economic output per person, possibly due to productivity gains or shifts in industry contributions.\n\nThe year 2021 marked a significant increase in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, even as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This indicates a robust economic recovery or expansion, likely driven by key industries. The growth continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching approximately $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, alongside a stable population of 3,276,208. This reflects strong economic performance across various sectors.\n\nIn 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, with the per capita GRP reaching $94,915.87, despite a population of 3,252,468. This continued growth suggests sustained economic development and possibly increased investment or innovation in the region. Over the five-year period, San Diego County's GRP increased by approximately $64.43 billion, reflecting a strong and growing economy. The per capita GRP increased by $21,568.95 from 2019 to 2023, indicating that the economic output per person has significantly improved. The population showed a slight decline from 2019 to 2023, which, coupled with the rising GRP, suggests increased productivity or shifts in the economic structure favoring higher-value industries. Overall, San Diego County's economy demonstrated resilience and growth, with increasing GRP and per capita GRP, despite minor fluctuations in population.",
