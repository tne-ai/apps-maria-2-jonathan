In 2019, the total GRP was $244.28 billion, with a population of 3,330,458, resulting in a GRP per capita of $73,346.92. Despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 saw a slight increase in GRP to $244.82 billion, even as the population decreased to 3,296,045. This led to a rise in GRP per capita to $74,277.60, indicating a stable economic performance during a challenging year.\n\nThe year 2021 marked a significant recovery, with the GRP increasing by approximately $24.05 billion to reach $268.87 billion. The population slightly decreased to 3,274,954, but the GRP per capita rose substantially to $82,099.95, reflecting post-pandemic economic recovery and growth. This upward trend continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching $296.68 billion, an increase of about $27.81 billion from the previous year. The population remained relatively stable at 3,276,208, while the GRP per capita increased significantly to $90,557.10, indicating strong economic performance.\n\nIn 2023, San Diego County's GRP reached $308.71 billion, marking a continued upward trend. The population decreased slightly to 3,252,468, but the GRP per capita increased to $94,915.87, suggesting sustained economic growth and prosperity in the region. Over the five-year period, the GRP increased by approximately $64.43 billion, reflecting a robust and resilient economy. The GRP per capita also showed a consistent upward trend, increasing by $21,568.95, indicating improved economic conditions and productivity per individual in the county. This data suggests that San Diego County has experienced robust economic growth, particularly in the post-pandemic years, with significant increases in both total GRP and GRP per capita.", 'type': 'raw text'}]}
