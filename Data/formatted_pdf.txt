            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting economic growth over this period. In 2019, the total GRP for San Diego County was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to approximately $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, suggesting an increase in economic output per person, possibly due to productivity gains or shifts in industry contributions.\n\nThe year 2021 marked a significant increase in GRP, reaching approximately $268.87 billion. The per capita GRP jumped to $82,099.95, with the population slightly decreasing to 3,274,954, indicating a robust economic recovery or expansion, likely driven by key industries. This growth continued into 2022, with the GRP reaching approximately $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, while the population remained stable at 3,276,208. This reflects strong performance across various sectors, contributing to higher economic output.\n\nIn 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, with a population of 3,252,468. This continued growth suggests sustained economic development and possibly increased investments or innovations within the region. Overall, over the five-year period, San Diego County's GRP increased by approximately $64.43 billion, reflecting a strong and resilient economy. The per capita GRP increased by $21,568.95, indicating significant growth in economic output per person, a positive sign of economic health and productivity. The consistent growth in GRP and per capita GRP suggests that San Diego County has been successful in leveraging its economic strengths, possibly in sectors like technology, healthcare, and tourism, to drive economic expansion.",
