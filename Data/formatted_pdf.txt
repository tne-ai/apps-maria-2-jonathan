            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, calculated by dividing the total GRP by the population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to approximately $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, suggesting an increase in economic output per person, even though the overall GRP growth was minimal. The year 2021 marked a significant increase in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, while the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This indicates a strong economic recovery or growth phase, likely due to post-pandemic economic activities. In 2022, the GRP continued to grow, reaching approximately $296.68 billion, and the per capita GRP increased to $90,557.10, with a stable population of 3,276,208. This reflects continued economic expansion and increased productivity. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, with a slight decrease in population to 3,252,468. This suggests that the economic output per individual continued to rise, indicating improved efficiency or higher value-added activities in the region. Overall, San Diego County's GRP has shown consistent growth from 2019 to 2023, with a notable increase in per capita GRP each year. The economic growth is reflected in the rising GRP figures and the increasing per capita GRP, suggesting that the region has been able to enhance its economic productivity and value generation over these years. The data indicates resilience and recovery, especially post-2020, with significant growth in 2021 and 2022, likely driven by various sectors contributing to the regional economy.",
