In this analysis, we delve into the GRP of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023, examining both the total GRP and the per capita GRP. This exploration offers insights into the region's economic growth and productivity over the specified period. The total GRP of San Diego County has demonstrated a consistent upward trajectory from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.3 billion, and it remained relatively stable into 2020, with a slight increase of about $543 million. However, a significant surge occurred between 2020 and 2021, with the GRP rising by approximately $24 billion, signaling a robust economic recovery post-pandemic. This growth continued from 2021 to 2022, with an increase of around $28 billion, and from 2022 to 2023, the GRP further increased by approximately $12 billion, reflecting sustained economic growth.",
