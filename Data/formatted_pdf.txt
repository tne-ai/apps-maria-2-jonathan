            "content": "The economic landscape of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 has been marked by a consistent upward trajectory in the Gross Regional Product (GRP), reflecting a period of robust economic growth. In 2019, the county's GRP stood at approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in the GRP to $244.82 billion. Despite a modest overall economic growth, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, even as the population decreased to 3,296,045. This suggests an increase in economic output per individual.\n\nThe year 2021 marked a significant economic recovery, with the GRP jumping to approximately $268.87 billion. The per capita GRP also saw a substantial increase to $82,099.95, despite a slight population decrease to 3,274,954. This indicates a strong economic rebound and growth during this period. The upward trend continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching approximately $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP climbing to $90,557.10, while the population was 3,276,208. This reflects ongoing economic expansion and increased productivity per individual.\n\nBy 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, with the per capita GRP reaching $94,915.87, even as the population slightly decreased to 3,252,468. This sustained economic growth highlights a high level of economic output per person, underscoring the resilience and strength of San Diego County's economy over these years.",
