            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the total GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to approximately $244.82 billion. Despite a slight decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, indicating an increase in economic output per person, even though the overall GRP growth was marginal. The year 2021 marked a significant increase in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This suggests a strong economic recovery or growth phase, likely influenced by post-pandemic economic activities. In 2022, the GRP continued to grow, reaching approximately $296.68 billion, and the per capita GRP increased to $90,557.10, with a stable population of 3,276,208. This reflects sustained economic expansion and increased productivity. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, with a population of 3,252,468. This continued growth suggests robust economic health and possibly the impact of strategic economic policies or investments. Overall, over the five-year period, San Diego County's GRP increased by approximately $64.43 billion, from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. The per capita GRP increased by $21,568.95, from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023. The consistent increase in both total and per capita GRP indicates a strong and growing economy, with increased productivity and economic output per individual. The slight fluctuations in population did not hinder economic growth, suggesting that the region's economic activities were robust enough to sustain and enhance economic output. This analysis highlights San Diego County's economic resilience and growth trajectory over the past five years.",
