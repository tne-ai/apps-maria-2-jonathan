            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, and by 2023, it had increased to about $308.71 billion. This growth represents an increase of approximately $64.43 billion over the five-year span. The annual GRP figures reveal a steady rise: $244.28 billion in 2019, $244.82 billion in 2020, $268.87 billion in 2021, $296.68 billion in 2022, and $308.71 billion in 2023. The yearly growth rates further illustrate this trend, with a modest increase of about 0.22% from 2019 to 2020, followed by a significant rise of approximately 9.82% from 2020 to 2021. The growth continued with a 10.34% increase from 2021 to 2022 and a 4.05% rise from 2022 to 2023. The per capita GRP also showed growth, indicating that the economic expansion was not solely due to population increase. In 2019, the per capita GRP was $73,346.92, which grew to $94,915.87 by 2023. This growth suggests that the economic gains were not just due to population growth but also due to increased productivity and economic activity. The GRP growth was relatively modest from 2019 to 2020, likely impacted by the global economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the significant growth from 2020 to 2022 suggests a strong economic recovery and expansion. Overall, San Diego County's economy demonstrated resilience and growth over the five-year period, with notable recovery and expansion post-2020.",
