      "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County has demonstrated a consistent upward trend from 2019 to 2023, reflecting a period of economic growth. In 2019, the total GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, suggesting an increase in economic output per person, possibly due to productivity gains or shifts in industry contributions. The year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, even as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This indicates a robust economic recovery or expansion, likely driven by key industries. In 2022, the GRP continued its growth trajectory, reaching approximately $296.68 billion, with a per capita GRP of $90,557.10 and a stable population of 3,276,208. This reflects strong economic performance and possibly increased investment or innovation in the region. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, with the per capita GRP reaching $94,915.87, despite a population decrease to 3,252,468. This sustained growth suggests continued economic development and resilience in the face of potential challenges. Overall, the GRP of San Diego County has shown consistent growth from 2019 to 2023, with a notable increase in both total and per capita GRP. The per capita GRP growth outpaced population growth, indicating increased economic productivity and possibly higher living standards. The economic expansion could be attributed to various factors, including growth in key industries such as technology, healthcare, and professional services. San Diego County's economy has demonstrated resilience and growth, reflecting positive economic conditions and potential for future development.",
