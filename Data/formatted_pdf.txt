Despite the global economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRP demonstrated resilience, increasing slightly to $244.82 billion in 2020. The subsequent years marked a strong economic recovery, with the GRP rising significantly to $268.87 billion in 2021, continuing to $296.68 billion in 2022, and reaching approximately $308.71 billion by 2023. This represents a total increase of about $64.43 billion over the five-year period, underscoring the region's robust economic growth.\n\nThe per capita GRP also experienced a notable rise, indicating an increase in economic productivity per person. In 2019, the per capita GRP was approximately $73,347, which grew to about $94,916 by 2023. This growth in per capita GRP highlights the enhanced economic output per individual in the region.\n\nWhen compared to state and national levels, San Diego County's economic performance is impressive. By 2023, the county's per capita GRP of $94,916 surpassed the California state average of $93,800 and was significantly higher than the national average of $77,366. This suggests that San Diego County's economy is thriving relative to broader benchmarks.\n\nThe county's economic growth is supported by key sectors such as Government, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and Manufacturing. The Government sector consistently contributed the highest dollar value to the GRP each year, with $52.92 billion in 2023. The Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector also showed strong growth, reaching $37.04 billion in 2023, while Manufacturing remained a significant contributor with $31.67 billion in 2023.
