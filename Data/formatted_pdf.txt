            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to approximately $244.82 billion. Despite a slight decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, indicating an increase in economic output per person, even though the overall GRP growth was minimal. The year 2021 marked a significant increase in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, as the population stood at 3,274,954. This reflects a strong economic recovery and growth post-2020. The growth continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching approximately $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, with a population of 3,276,208. This indicates sustained economic expansion and increased productivity. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, despite a slight population decrease to 3,252,468. The continued rise in per capita GRP suggests that economic output per individual continued to grow, even as the population slightly declined. Overall, San Diego County's GRP has shown consistent growth from 2019 to 2023, with notable increases in both total GRP and per capita GRP. The growth in per capita GRP indicates that the region's economic productivity per person has been improving, which is a positive sign of economic health and efficiency. The data suggests that San Diego County has been able to recover and grow economically, even in the face of challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.",
