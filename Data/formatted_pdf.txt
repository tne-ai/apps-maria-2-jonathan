            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to about $244.82 billion. Interestingly, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045. This suggests that the economic output per person increased, even as the overall population decreased. The year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, alongside a population of 3,274,954. This indicates a strong economic recovery and growth post-2020. The upward trajectory continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching around $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, with a population of 3,276,208. This reflects ongoing economic expansion and increased productivity. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, with a population of 3,252,468. This suggests sustained economic growth and a high level of economic output per individual. Overall, over the five-year period, San Diego County's GRP increased by approximately $64.43 billion, from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. The per capita GRP increased by $21,568.95, from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023. The consistent increase in both total GRP and per capita GRP indicates robust economic growth and improved productivity in San Diego County over these years. Despite fluctuations in population, the economic output per person has shown a positive trend, highlighting the region's economic resilience and development.",
