In 2019, the total GRP was $244.28 billion, with a population of 3,330,458, resulting in a GRP per capita of $73,346.92. The following year, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRP slightly increased to $244.82 billion. This resilience is further highlighted by the rise in GRP per capita to $74,277.60, even as the population decreased to 3,296,045. By 2021, the county experienced a significant economic recovery, with the GRP climbing to $268.87 billion and the GRP per capita reaching $82,099.95. This growth reflects an improved economic productivity and output per person. The upward trend continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching $296.68 billion and the GRP per capita increasing to $90,557.10, indicating strong economic performance and an increase in the economic value generated per resident. In 2023, the GRP peaked at $308.71 billion, with a GRP per capita of $94,915.87, suggesting sustained economic growth and efficiency in San Diego County's economy.
