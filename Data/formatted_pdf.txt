            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to about $244.82 billion. Despite a minor population decrease to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, indicating an increase in economic output per person even though the overall GRP growth was minimal. \n\nThe year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP, reaching approximately $268.87 billion. The per capita GRP also saw a substantial increase to $82,099.95, with the population slightly decreasing to 3,274,954. This suggests a strong economic recovery and growth, likely driven by post-pandemic economic activities. In 2022, the GRP continued its upward trajectory, reaching around $296.68 billion, while the per capita GRP increased to $90,557.10, with a stable population of 3,276,208. This reflects ongoing economic expansion and heightened productivity. \n\nBy 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, despite a slight population decrease to 3,252,468. This suggests that economic output per person continued to rise, indicating improved efficiency and economic health. Overall, over the five-year period, San Diego County's GRP grew by approximately 26.4%, from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. The per capita GRP increased by about 29.4%, from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023. The consistent increase in both total GRP and per capita GRP suggests robust economic growth and improved productivity in San Diego County during this period. The data indicates that the region has effectively navigated economic challenges, including those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and has emerged with a stronger economic output.",
