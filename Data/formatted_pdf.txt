            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting economic growth over this period. In 2019, the total GRP for San Diego County was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92. This was calculated by dividing the total GRP by the population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to approximately $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, suggesting an increase in economic output per person, possibly due to productivity gains or shifts in industry contributions.\n\nThe year 2021 marked a significant increase in GRP, reaching approximately $268.87 billion. The per capita GRP jumped to $82,099.95, even as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This indicates a robust economic recovery or expansion, likely driven by key industries. In 2022, the GRP continued to grow, reaching approximately $296.68 billion, with the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10 and a stable population of 3,276,208. This growth reflects strong performance across various sectors, contributing to higher economic output.\n\nBy 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, with the per capita GRP reaching $94,915.87 and a population of 3,252,468.

Overall, San Diego County's GRP growth from 2019 to 2023 highlights a resilient and expanding economy, with significant increases in both total and per capita GRP. This growth may be attributed to various factors, including industry diversification, technological advancements, and strategic economic policies.",
