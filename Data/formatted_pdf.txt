            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, and by 2023, it had risen to about $308.71 billion. This increase of roughly $64.43 billion over five years highlights the region's robust economic expansion. The annual GRP figures reveal a steady climb: $244.28 billion in 2019, $244.82 billion in 2020, $268.87 billion in 2021, $296.68 billion in 2022, and $308.71 billion in 2023. Yearly growth rates further illustrate this trend, with a modest increase of approximately 0.22% from 2019 to 2020, followed by a significant growth of about 9.82% from 2020 to 2021, 10.34% from 2021 to 2022, and 4.05% from 2022 to 2023. The per capita GRP also showed an upward trajectory, indicating that the economic growth was not solely due to population increases. In 2019, the per capita GRP was $73,346.92, rising to $94,915.87 by 2023. This growth suggests improvements in productivity and economic output per individual in the region. Notably, the most substantial growth in GRP occurred between 2020 and 2022, with double-digit growth rates likely reflecting recovery and expansion following the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, San Diego County experienced robust economic growth from 2019 to 2023, with both total GRP and per capita GRP increasing significantly. This growth reflects a strong regional economy with potential contributions from various sectors, including technology, tourism, and defense, which are prominent in the area.",
