            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trajectory, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to about $244.82 billion. Despite a minor population decrease to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, indicating an increase in economic output per person even though the overall GRP growth was minimal. \n\nThe year 2021 marked a significant economic recovery and growth, with the GRP rising to approximately $268.87 billion and the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, amidst a population of 3,274,954. This trend continued into 2022, as the GRP reached around $296.68 billion, and the per capita GRP increased to $90,557.10, with a population of 3,276,208. This suggests robust economic performance and heightened productivity. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, with the per capita GRP reaching $94,915.87, despite a slight population decrease to 3,252,468. The continued rise in per capita GRP underscores sustained economic growth and efficiency.\n\nOverall, San Diego County's GRP has shown a consistent upward trend from 2019 to 2023, with a notable acceleration in growth from 2021 onwards. The per capita GRP has also increased each year, indicating rising economic output per person, a positive sign of economic health and productivity. The slight fluctuations in population did not hinder the overall economic growth, as evidenced by the increasing per capita GRP. The data suggests that San Diego County has been experiencing strong economic performance, with significant growth in GRP and per capita GRP over the analyzed period.",
