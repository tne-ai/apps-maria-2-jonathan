            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County has demonstrated a consistent upward trend from 2019 to 2023, reflecting a period of economic growth. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to $244.82 billion. Despite a decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, indicating an increase in economic output per person, even though the overall GRP growth was marginal. The year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This suggests a robust economic recovery and growth post-2020. In 2022, the GRP continued its upward trajectory, reaching approximately $296.68 billion, and the per capita GRP increased to $90,557.10, with a stable population of 3,276,208. This reflects strong economic performance and increased productivity. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, with a population of 3,252,468. This continued growth in per capita GRP suggests ongoing economic expansion and efficiency improvements. Overall, San Diego County's GRP has shown consistent growth from 2019 to 2023, with notable increases in both total GRP and per capita GRP. The growth in per capita GRP indicates that the economic output per individual has increased, suggesting improvements in productivity and economic conditions. The data reflects a resilient economy that has managed to grow despite challenges, such as the global pandemic in 2020. The recovery and growth in subsequent years highlight the region's economic strength and adaptability.",
