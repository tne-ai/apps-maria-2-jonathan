            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. The following year, 2020, saw a slight increase in GRP to about $244.82 billion. Despite a minor decrease in population to 3,296,045, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, indicating an increase in economic output per person, even though the overall GRP growth was minimal. The year 2021 marked a significant rise in GRP to approximately $268.87 billion, with the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, as the population slightly decreased to 3,274,954. This suggests a strong economic recovery and growth, likely driven by post-pandemic economic activities. The growth continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching around $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, while the population remained stable at 3,276,208. This reflects ongoing economic expansion and increased productivity. By 2023, the GRP further increased to approximately $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, with a population of 3,252,468. The continued rise in per capita GRP suggests that economic output per individual continued to grow, contributing to the overall economic health of the region. Overall, San Diego County's GRP has shown a consistent increase from 2019 to 2023, with a notable acceleration in growth from 2021 onwards. The per capita GRP has also increased each year, indicating that the economic output per person has been rising, which is a positive sign of economic health and productivity. The population has seen slight fluctuations, but the overall economic growth has outpaced these changes, leading to higher per capita GRP figures. This analysis highlights the resilience and growth of San Diego County's economy over the past five years, with significant gains in economic output and productivity.",
