            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates a consistent upward trend, reflecting significant economic growth over this period. In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, with a per capita GRP of $73,346.92, based on a population of 3,330,458. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 saw a slight increase in GRP to $244.82 billion. Interestingly, the per capita GRP rose to $74,277.60, even as the population decreased to 3,296,045. This suggests that while the overall economic output remained stable, the per capita output increased due to a smaller population.\n\nThe year 2021 marked a significant economic recovery, with the GRP rising to $268.87 billion and the per capita GRP jumping to $82,099.95, despite a slight population decrease to 3,274,954. This indicates a robust economic rebound post-pandemic. The growth continued in 2022, with the GRP reaching $296.68 billion and the per capita GRP increasing to $90,557.10, alongside a stable population of 3,276,208. This suggests strong economic performance and increased productivity.\n\nIn 2023, the GRP further increased to $308.71 billion, and the per capita GRP reached $94,915.87, with a population of 3,252,468. The continued rise in per capita GRP indicates sustained economic growth and efficiency. Overall, San Diego County's economy demonstrated resilience and growth from 2019 to 2023, with the GRP increasing by approximately 26.4% over the five-year period. The significant rise in per capita GRP highlights improved economic productivity and output per person, suggesting that the county has effectively navigated economic challenges, including the pandemic, and maintained a trajectory of economic expansion.",
