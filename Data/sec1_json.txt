    "details": "The analysis is based on GRP data from 2019 to 2023, showing a total increase of $64.43 billion. The per capita GRP was calculated by dividing the total GRP by the population, indicating economic growth outpacing population growth. Sectoral contributions were significant from Government, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and Manufacturing. The per capita GRP in 2023 was compared to California's state average of $93,800 and the national average of $77,366.",
    "recommendations": "Consider investing in key sectors like Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services to sustain economic growth. Monitor population growth to ensure per capita GRP continues to rise.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The data does not specify the exact population figures used for per capita GRP calculations, which could affect accuracy. Additionally, sectoral contributions are not detailed annually, limiting deeper analysis."
