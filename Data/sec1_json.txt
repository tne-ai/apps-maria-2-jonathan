    "details": "The analysis uses GRP data from 2019 to 2023 for San Diego County. The per capita GRP is calculated by dividing the total GRP by the population for each year. The data shows a consistent increase in both GRP and per capita GRP, despite slight population decreases. The significant growth in 2021 and 2022 suggests a strong post-pandemic economic recovery. The source data includes GRP values, population figures, and calculated per capita GRP for each year.",
    "recommendations": "To sustain economic growth, San Diego County should continue to invest in high-value sectors and enhance productivity. Monitoring population trends and addressing potential labor shortages could further support economic expansion.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The request for GRP analysis is clear, and the data provided is sufficient for a reliable analysis. However, more detailed sector-specific data could enhance understanding of the drivers behind the economic growth."
