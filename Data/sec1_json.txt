    "details": "The analysis is based on GRP data from 2019 to 2023, showing a total increase of $64.43 billion. The per capita GRP was calculated by dividing the total GRP by the population, indicating economic growth outpacing population growth. Sector contributions were analyzed, highlighting Government, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and Manufacturing as major contributors. The per capita GRP in 2023 was $94,916, compared to California's $93,800 and the national average of $77,366.",
    "recommendations": "Consider investing in key sectors like Professional Services and Manufacturing to sustain economic growth. Monitor population growth to ensure per capita GRP continues to rise.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The data does not specify the exact population figures used for per capita GRP calculations, which could affect accuracy. Additionally, sector-specific data for 2020-2022 is missing, limiting detailed analysis for those years."
