    "subhead": "San Diego County's GRP grew from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023, with significant increases in per capita GRP, indicating robust economic growth and productivity improvements.",
    "details": "The analysis uses annual GRP data from 2019 to 2023, showing a total increase of $64.43 billion. Yearly growth rates were calculated using the formula: ((GRP in current year - GRP in previous year) / GRP in previous year) * 100. Per capita GRP was derived by dividing the total GRP by the population for each year. The data reflects economic recovery post-COVID-19, with notable growth between 2020 and 2022.",
    "recommendations": "Consider investing in sectors that contributed to the GRP growth, such as technology, tourism, and defense. Monitor economic policies that support continued growth and productivity improvements.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The request for GRP analysis was clear, but the data lacks specific sector contributions to the GRP, which could provide deeper insights into the drivers of economic growth."
