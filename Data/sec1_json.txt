    "bodyText": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) for San Diego County showed consistent growth from 2019 to 2023. The total GRP increased from $244.3 billion in 2019 to $308.7 billion in 2023, while the population slightly decreased from 3,330,458 to 3,252,468.

    "subhead": "San Diego County's GRP grew from $244.3 billion in 2019 to $308.7 billion in 2023, with GRP per capita rising from $73,346.92 to $94,915.87, despite a slight population decline.",
    "details": "The analysis uses data on total GRP and population for San Diego County from 2019 to 2023. GRP per capita is calculated by dividing total GRP by the population for each year. The data shows a consistent increase in GRP and GRP per capita, with a slight decrease in population over the period. The calculations are straightforward: GRP per Capita = Total GRP / Population.",
    "recommendations": "Consider strategies to sustain economic growth while addressing population decline, such as attracting new residents or enhancing workforce development programs.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The data provided is sufficient for the analysis, but further insights could be gained by examining sector-specific contributions to GRP and demographic changes affecting population trends."
