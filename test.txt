In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, and by 2023, it had increased to about $308.71 billion. This growth of approximately $64.43 billion over five years highlights the region's robust economic performance. The annual GRP growth reflects a steady upward trajectory, with a slight increase from 2019 to 2020, indicating resilience despite potential economic challenges. A significant recovery phase is evident from 2020 to 2021, as the GRP rose to $268.87 billion. This positive trend continued through 2022, reaching $296.68 billion, and further into 2023, culminating at $308.71 billion.",

This growth indicates an enhancement in economic productivity per individual in the region. When compared to state and national levels, San Diego County's per capita GRP consistently outperformed the national average throughout the period. In 2023, the county's per capita GRP was $94,916, surpassing California's average of $93,800 and the national average of $77,366. Key sectors driving this economic growth included Government, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and Manufacturing. The Government sector was the largest contributor, with $52.92 billion in 2023, followed by the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector at $37.04 billion, and Manufacturing at $31.67 billion. These sectors played a crucial role in the region's economic resilience and recovery, particularly during the pandemic period from 2020 to 2021. The consistent growth in both GRP and per capita GRP underscores a robust economic environment with increasing productivity and output.",
